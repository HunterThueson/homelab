# environment/default.nix

# Master list of environment module paths.
# Imported by both mkHosts.nix and mkHomes.nix.
#
# Each entry resolves to either:
#   - A plain HM module (function)        → injected into HM only
#   - A dual-export { nixos; home; }       → nixos part added to NixOS, home part to HM
#
# Directories with multiple modules return a list (via import);
# directories whose default.nix IS the module are listed as paths.
